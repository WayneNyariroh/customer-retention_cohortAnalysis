### Part 2 of the [SuperStore EDA](https://github.com/WayneNyariroh/StoreSales_Analysis)

Using the concept of cohorts to determine customer retention rates for the Store, i.e, how many customers who first purchased on a specific similiar period are still returning to make purchases with the store in subsequent months and/or years.
> We will create a pivot table and a heatmap to assist with visualization of the analysis.
